# Sym-Biote
A simple, semi-easy to use symlink tool

# Warnings
Due to the nature of AutoHotkey and the fact this tool both requires admin permissions AND include each script as seperate executables, your AV of choice will most definitely flag it as malware.. This is safe to ignore, I promise. Also, please be aware that the symlink creation module has not been well tested and may result in errors when creating more than 1 line
